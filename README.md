# Stroke Prediction Web Application using Streamlit 

Created a Web Application using Streamlit and Machine learning models on Stroke prediciton Whether the paitent gets a stroke or not on the basis of the feature columns given in the dataset

🚀 Stroke is a serious medical condition that can have life-altering consequences and is recognized as one of the leading causes of death globally. According to the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke remains the 2nd leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.💊💡

In this analysis, we explore the factors that influence stroke occurrences and employ machine learning techniques to predict stroke risks. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke based on input parameters such as gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.🧪📈

Early prediction and identification of potential stroke cases are crucial for timely medical intervention and better health outcomes. Join us on this journey as we examine the relationships between various health parameters, lifestyle factors, and the likelihood of stroke. Together, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of stroke risks and prevention.💡

Additionally, we will discuss the dangers of stroke and the importance of stroke prevention in improving public health.⏳

# Key Features 📊📈
age: This is the age of the patient. Age is a crucial factor in stroke prediction as the risk of stroke increases with age. According to the World Health Organization, the risk of stroke doubles every decade after the age of 55. 🌡️👴

hypertension: This is a binary feature indicating whether the patient has hypertension (high blood pressure) or not. Hypertension is a significant risk factor for stroke as it can damage blood vessels, making them prone to blockage or rupture. 💉🩺

heart_disease: This binary feature indicates whether the patient has heart disease or not. Patients with heart diseases are at a higher risk of stroke as these conditions can lead to the formation of clots in the heart that can travel to the brain. ❤️💔

ever_married: This feature represents whether the patient is married or not. Although not a direct risk factor for stroke, marital status can be associated with lifestyle factors that influence stroke risk. For instance, married individuals might have different stress levels, physical activity patterns, or dietary habits compared to their unmarried counterparts. 💍👫

work_type: This categorical feature describes the type of occupation of the patient. Certain occupations might be associated with higher stress levels or sedentary behavior, which can influence stroke risk. 👷‍♀️👨‍⚕️👩‍💼

Residence_type: This feature indicates whether the patient lives in a rural or urban area. The place of residence might be associated with stroke risk due to factors like access to healthcare, air quality, lifestyle habits, etc. 🏡🌆🌳

avg_glucose_level: This feature represents the average glucose level in the patient's blood. High blood glucose levels can damage blood vessels, leading to an increased risk of stroke. 🩸🍬

bmi: This is the Body Mass Index of the patient, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI indicates obesity, which is a significant risk factor for stroke as it can lead to or exacerbate conditions like hypertension, high blood glucose, and heart disease. 🏋️‍♀️🍔

smoking_status: This categorical feature indicates whether the patient is a smoker, former smoker, or never smoked. Smoking can increase stroke risk as it can damage blood vessels, increase blood pressure, and reduce the amount of oxygen reaching the brain. 🚬🚭

gender: This feature represents the gender of the patient. Gender can influence stroke risk due to biological differences and gender-specific lifestyle patterns. ♀️♂️
